## üìñ Overview

Titan AI Smart Contract Assist streamlines the smart contract lifecycle by combining state-of-the-art Agentic AI. It simplifies everything from code generation and interactive editing to comprehensive security auditing and live deployment on testnet network.

Titan AI Smart Contract Assist is an AI-powered solution that lets developers create, test, and deploy smart contracts interactively. With real-time suggestions, security audits, and seamless on-chain deployment, it provides a one-stop solution for smart contract development.


## üîç With Titan AI, developers can:

- **Generate Smart Contract Code:** Describe your idea in natural language and receive generated smart contract code.
- **Receive Tailored Recommendations:** Get instant, actionable feedback to enhance security, performance, and functionality.
- **Edit Code Interactively:** Use a powerful multi-file editor to manage and refine your project files.
- **Conduct Security Audits:** Automatically scan contracts for vulnerabilities and obtain detailed security reports.
- **Deploy Seamlessly:** Deploy contracts directly to testnet network.
- **Maintain Context:** Titan AI uses your project‚Äôs context (requirements and code files) to provide highly relevant suggestions.

## üí° Features

- **Interactive Code Generation:** Chat with Titan AI to dynamically generate smart contract code.
- **Real-Time Feedback:** Receive immediate, detailed recommendations for code improvements and security.
- **Multi-File Editor:** Manage multiple files with a sleek, integrated code editor powered by Monaco.
- **Automated Security Audits:** Detect vulnerabilities and receive actionable fixes automatically.
- **Seamless Deployment:** Deploy smart contracts directly to testnet network.
- **Context-Aware Assistance:** Enjoy tailored suggestions based on your project‚Äôs requirements and current code.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Benefit from an intuitive and modern UI that streamlines development.

## üë®‚Äçüíª Use Cases
